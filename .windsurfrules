## General Rules to follow strictly!
I LIKE ONE WORD ANSWERS WHERE POSSIBLE.
OPTIMIZE TOKENS, I WILL ASK FOR ADDITIONAL INFO.
KEEP THE CHANGES SMALL SO WE CAN TEST EACH PIECE.
DO NOT REMOVE PREVIOUS CONSOLE OUT PRINTS THEY ARE THERE FOR A REASON!
NEVER REMOVE EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY - THINGS ARE IN PLACE FOR A GOOD REASON
LETS USE AGILE AND TEST DRIVEN APPROACHES TO MAKE SMALL CHANGES AND ITERATE
ASK BEFORE MAKING THE NEXT SET OF CHANGES.

## Project Overview
This is a Stock Price Prediction application that uses machine learning models to predict stock prices.

## Key Components
- Data processing and validation rules
- Model configuration and training parameters
- Feature engineering specifications
- UI display guidelines
- Error handling protocols
- Data quality standards

## Code Style Guidelines
### General
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Include docstrings for all functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Use type hints where appropriate

### Data Processing
- Validate data against DATA_RULES from rules.py
- Required columns: Open, High, Low, Close, Volume
- Handle missing values using forward fill (ffill)
- Ensure data quality meets QUALITY_RULES standards

### Model Development
Follow MODEL_RULES specifications:
- Train/test split: 80/20
- Validation size: 10% of training data
- Minimum samples: 30
- Acceptable missing data: 10%

### Feature Engineering
Follow FEATURE_RULES guidelines:
- Implement required technical indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, BB)
- Use specified window sizes: [5, 10, 20, 50]
- Normalize features when specified
- Handle missing values according to rules

### UI Development
Follow UI_RULES specifications:
- Maximum 10 tickers selectable at once
- Refresh interval: 60 seconds
- Price decimals: 2 places
- Use comma format for volumes
- Default chart height: 400px

### Error Handling
Follow ERROR_RULES guidelines:
- Maximum 3 retries for failed API calls
- 5-second delay between retries
- 30-second timeout for API calls
- Log all errors when specified

### Market Rules
Respect market hours (EST):
- Open: 09:30
- Close: 16:00
Handle pre-market and after-hours data appropriately

## Testing Guidelines
- Write unit tests for all new functions
- Include integration tests for data pipeline components
- Test edge cases for market open/close scenarios
- Validate predictions against quality thresholds

## Documentation Requirements
- Document all configuration changes in rules.py
- Include clear docstrings explaining function parameters
- Comment complex algorithms and business logic
- Update README.md with new features

## Performance Guidelines
- Optimize data fetching operations
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Minimize API calls to external services
- Profile and optimize model prediction time

## Security Considerations
- Validate all user inputs
- Handle API keys securely
- Implement rate limiting for external API calls
- Sanitize data before display
